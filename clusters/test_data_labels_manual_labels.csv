32,"Recently, BCG commissioned a survey spanning fifteen companies, seven industries, and three geographies. Respondents included 250 sustainability professionals, of which 50 were chief sustainability officers. The findings demonstrate both a problem and an opportunity. Sustainability talent has a steep learning curve, and the industry is rapidly evolving. Upskilling remains the biggest challenge for those currently in-role; however, most training material lacks contextual relevance and practicality. The sustainability workforce finds it difficult to identify snackable and interactive courses tied to real-world needs. This forces employees to learn on-the-job, sift through piles of reports and white papers trying to figure out how to apply learnings in real life, and hoping to get approval to attend conferences. This takes time, creates inefficiencies, introduces risk, creates friction, and stalls progress. To achieve the SDGs by 2030, corporate-wide adoption of sustainability practices is required. If those currently in sustainability roles have friction, the upskilling challenge sets nonexperts up for failure. The slow pathway to sustainability is correlated with the need for inclusive upskilling. Experts agreeÃhuman capital development is urgently needed, and it must start now within all companies, industries, and roles.

51,"The problem that the solution of composting waste vegetables aims to solve is the inefficient use and management of organic waste, which leads to negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to the depletion of non-renewable resources. Landfills, where a significant amount of waste ends up, produce methane gas during the decomposition of organic waste, which is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.

The composting of waste vegetables provides a sustainable and eco-friendly solution to this problem. By collecting and composting waste vegetables, resources are maximized, waste is minimized, and a valuable natural fertilizer is produced. The resulting compost can be used to improve soil health and increase crop yields, contributing to sustainable agriculture practices.

Composting waste vegetables reduces greenhouse gas emissions by diverting organic waste from landfills, thereby mitigating the environmental impact of waste management practices.

Companies can benefit from this solution by implementing composting programs for their organic waste, using compost as an alternative to chemical fertilizers, and collaborating with local NGOs and waste management organizations to support the circular economy and create positive social impacts.

It also intends to create awareness regarding menstrual health and hygiene.

PROBLEM: According to the reports provided by the Menstrual Hygiene Alliance of India, currently, there are over 355 million menstruating women and girls in the country. On an average, 24 pads are used by an Indian woman each month. This amounts to 12 billion sanitary pads discarded every year. India faces a severe problem concerning sanitary waste management resulting in 9000 tonnes of sanitary waste! Moreover, due to the regressive outlook of our society towards menstruation, there needs to be more discourse around the topic, and thus a discussion is highly needed. In search of a direly required sustainable solution, we, the students of Jamia Millia Islamia, came up with Project Shrimati.",0,0

72,"The problem that this idea is meant to address is the large amount of waste generated in the construction industry. In particular, the construction process generates a significant amount of waste from building materials, tools, and equipment. This waste contributes to landfills, pollution, and resource depletion. Additionally, traditional construction practices often result in buildings and structures that are designed for a single use and have a limited lifespan, leading to the frequent demolition and replacement of buildings. This results in the loss of valuable resources, including materials, energy, and labor.

The idea is to promote the use of modular building components that can be reused and repurposed in different construction projects, reducing waste and conserving resources. By using modular components that can be easily disassembled, transported, and reassembled, builders and developers can reduce the amount of waste generated in the construction process, while still producing high-quality, durable buildings. This approach can also help to create a more circular construction industry, where waste is reduced and resources are conserved.",0,0
