E-waste contains hazardous elements that can be detrimental to the environment and human health if not managed properly.  \", 'solution': \"The proposal lies in creating a robust 'E-Waste Cycle Economy'. The business model primarily involves collection, refurbishment, reselling and recycling of electronic waste. Corporations, especially those manufacturing electronic goods, can adopt this model to create a cyclical flow of their products.  1. Collection: Businesses can set up certified and responsible e-waste collection centers. Customers can drop off their end-of-life electronic products at these centers, possibly in exchange for a small incentive, thus providing a financial benefit to the consumer and promoting participation. These centers would ensure that hazardous waste is handled responsibly and doesn't accumulate in landfills.  2. Refurbishment: Not all elements of an electronic product wear out at the same pace. Therefore, these collected products can be examined for working components. These components can be refurbished or improved as needed and used in the production of newer devices.   3. Reselling: Fully functional refurbished devices can be sold at affordable prices. This gives financially disadvantaged individuals access to necessary technologies, generating customer value and potentially unlocking new markets for businesses.  4. Recycling: For devices that cannot be refurbished, valuable and rare elements like gold, copper, nickel etc. can be extracted and reused to manufacture new products.   This model can significantly reduce extraction pressure on natural resources and combat the growing e-waste problem. Further, it offers financial returns through selling refurbished products and recycling valuable metals from e-waste.   Moreover, if key players in the technology industry follow the E-Waste Cycle Economy, it sets a precedent for smaller businesses to do the same, making this solution highly scalable. Significant uptake of this model can potentially revolutionise how the electronics industry operates, fostering greater sustainability. Therefore, the E-Waste Cycle Economy could contribute significantly to evolving technology towards a zero-waste future.\"}"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{'relevance_problem': 3, 'clarity_problem': 3, 'suitability_solution': 3, 'clarity_solution': 3}"}]}
